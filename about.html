<h1 class="heading">About Dale</h1>
<p style="font-size: 130%; color: white ";> I write about whatever comes to mind at any point. <br>
It's paramount to have an outlet in order to express your feelings at any given moment <br>
My outlet is writing. I've been writing creatively for seven years, academically for four. I've even started dabbling in songwriting <br>
It's a means to both escape reality for a bit, and a way to meaningfully express the emotions that I have before they bubble over <br>
Here's my <a href="https://booksie.com/portfolio-view/dale-craig/242038" style="color: white;"> portfolio</a> for those of you who'd like to read <br> <br>
But writing isn't the only thing I love doing <br> 
With the songwriting, I want to hone my voice to be able to perform in my choice of genres: metal, rock, and RnB <br>
Metal is probably the most influential genre in my life at the moment. The energy is something I haven't experienced with any other genre, and the lyrical 
content perfectly mirrors my current mentality and reminds me of the dark places i've come from and the strength that they've given me<br> <br> 
I love cooking. Most of my YouTube recommended page is now filled with 
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/bingingwithbabish" style="color: white;">Binging with Babish</a>,
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/mythicalkitchen" style="color: white;"> Mythical Kitchen </a>,
and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/JoshuaWeissman" style="color: white;"> Joshua Weismann</a> videos <br>
I enjoy working on myself, whether that be on my body or my mind. I enjoy working out, particularly lifting weights and cycling. Reading, writing, and 
meditation are big parts of my day, as they help me keep a handle on my mental state.
